Today you set up and stabilized your full-stack Gym Management app by properly running the backend,
 connecting the frontend to protected APIs, and completing full CRUD for Members (add, view, edit, delete). You implemented authentication with tokens, added a logout flow,
  and learned how AuthContext + useAuth work together. You also fixed real-world React errors caused by default vs named exports, understanding why consistent imports matter. 
  Overall, you moved from setup confusion to a clean, professional project structure with a clear mental model of how frontend, backend, auth, and routing connect.
